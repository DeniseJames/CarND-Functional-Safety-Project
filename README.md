# Functional Safety of a Lane Assistance System


This project helps make a functional safety case based on the ISO26262 and the Udacity lecture notes.  The included five documents 
 are simplified versions of what a functional safety manager would create as part of a safety case. A safety case is a collection of documents proving that a project has made a vehicle safer.


### Description of Safety Documents.
